# n8n-nodes-budibasedb

Connect to your Budibase DB and perform CRUD operations on:

- Applications
- Rows
- Tables

## Required config

To get started, you will need:

- an API Key
- an App ID
- a base URL

To connect to a cloud environment, replace `tenant` with your own tenant ID.

Self-hosted users can replace `tenant.budibase.app` with their own domain.

View the [Public API](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/public-api) docs to see how to get the API Key and App ID.
